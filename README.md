# Complex Diagram Editor

This plugin takes diagram information a project in Geodesignhub using the [Geodesignhub](https://www.geodesignhub.com/). It then provides a way edit them and then upload edited polygon to a different or same system as a new diagram available to be used in a design. This is especially useful when you are working with complex polygons / shapes. These are normally created / generated in GIS systems but are added to a Geodesignhub project.
